The following steps are involved in the project:

Data gathering and preparation

Exploration and visualisation of data

Data division for training and testing

Model construction with the logreg and dectree algorithm

MOVIE RATING PREDICTION

Techniques : Predictive Modeling, Regression Modeling, Feature Expraction, Preprocessing, Visualizeation

Developed regression model for predicting movie revenue and ratings from 5,000 movie data.

Performed data analysis, visualization, feature extraction, cleaning. To make sure the analysis was based on complete data, I dropped rows with missing ratings.
